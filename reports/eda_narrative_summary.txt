# Student Performance Dataset Analysis

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 395 students with 33 features.

## Grade Distribution Analysis
- Average final grade (G3): 10.42
- Standard deviation: 4.58
- Students with G3 >= 10 (passing): 265 (67.1%)

## Key Findings
• The correlation between G1 and G3 is 0.801
• The correlation between G2 and G3 is 0.905
• Students study on average 2.0 hours per week
• Average absences: 5.7

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, early grades (G1, G2) are strong predictors of final performance.
Intervention programs should focus on students with low G1/G2 scores.
